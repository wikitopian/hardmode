INTRODUCTION                                    *hardmode*

Hard Mode is a plugin which disables the arrow keys, the hjkl keys,
the page up/down keys, and a handful of other keys which allow one
to rely on character-wise navigation. The philosophy behind Hard Mode
is that you'll never master Vim's advanced motion and search functionality
if you can fall back on the anti-pattern of fumbling around your code with
the arrow keys.

MAPPINGS                                        *hardmode-mappings*

To enable it:
:call HardMode()

To disable it:
:call EasyMode()

To enable it by default, add this to your |vimrc|:
autocmd VimEnter,BufNewFile,BufReadPost * silent! call HardMode()

You may also wish to add the following to lines to your |vimrc|:
nnoremap <leader>h <Esc>:call EasyMode()<CR>
nnoremap <leader>H <Esc>:call HardMode()<CR>

With those lines added, presuming your leader is still the \ key, you
can enable Hard Mode by pressing \H while in |Normal-mode| and disable it
by pressing \h while in |Normal-mode|.

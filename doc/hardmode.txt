INTRODUCTION                                    *hardmode*

Hard Mode is a plugin which disables the arrow keys, the hjkl keys,
the page up/down keys, and a handful of other keys which allow one
to rely on character-wise navigation. The philosophy behind Hard Mode
is that you'll never master Vim's advanced motion and search functionality
if you can fall back on the anti-pattern of fumbling around your code with
the arrow keys.

MAPPINGS                                        *hardmode-mappings*

To enable it: >
	:call HardMode()
To disable it: >
	:call EasyMode()
To toggle it: >
	:call ToggleHardMode()
To have it always enabled, add this to your |vimrc|: >
	let g:hardmode = 1

Toggling it is done with |<Leader>|h by default, but you can override it
by adding a line like this to your |vimrc|: >
	nnoremap <Leader>H <Esc>:call ToggleHardMode()<CR>

Presuming your leader is still the \ key, you can toggle Hard Mode by
pressing \h while in |Normal-mode|.
